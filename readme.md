# Diimensions
Diimensions is a 3D web experience created in three days by students at [IIM](https://www.iim.fr/). Inspired by the Spider-Verse universe, this experience allows users to follow a Spider-Man through different dimensions. With each transition, the maps and textures change, mimicking the film's unique aesthetic.
